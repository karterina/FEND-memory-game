## How to play

This is a concentration game. Game field contains 16 cards: 2 of each of 8 different types. The player clicks on 2 cards to see if they match. As soon as a card is clicked, the timer starts. Clicking two cards is 1 move - the more moves the player makes, the less stars the player gets. The game ends when all the cards in the field are matched. The ultimate goal is to find all matching cards in the least amount of moves.
